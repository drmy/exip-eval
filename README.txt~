This project is a public release of the evaluation of the performance of the dedicated EXI grammar
generator implemented as part of the EXIP library. The grammar generator accepts
EXI encoded XML Schema definitions as an input
A set of 5 XML schema documents (available in Schemas) are used for decoding 15 instances (XML examples that conform to the schema; 3 instances per
each schema document) by 3 different EXI processors - EXIficient v0.9.1 Java [Peint-
ner 2013], OpenEXI v1.0238.0 Java [Kamiya 2013], and EXIP v0.5.1 C [Kyusakov
2013a]. The XML schema documents are: netconf.xsd 3 , SenML.xsd 4 , sep.xsd 5 , OPC-
UA-Types.xsd 6 , and XMLSchema.xsd 7 . All of them were accessed from the local hard-
drive, including the imported XML schema files, so there were no dependencies on the
network performance.
